-brief description of design of tokenizer
The tokenizer class currently has two main methods: getToken() and skipToken(). getToken will read the current token without altering the location it's reading from. skipToken will skip ahead and update the index until it reaches the next token.
-brief user manual how to use tokenizer
To use the tokenizer, create the Tplemozer with the path to a file you wish to tokenize as an argument. You can then either get a token or skip to the next token. 
-brief description of how tokenizer tested
The tokenizer was tested against the test files given on the website.
-list of remaining bugs
I'm still having trouble with some string indexing going beyond bounds (especially in the case of reading double character tokens, such as == or ||), and with the tokenizer knowing to read a whole identifier even if it has numerals in it.
